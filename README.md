 Music catageory code that will auto sort my liked playlist and give reccommendations based off of genere or artist

**** Final Project *****
The final project was a sucess and i have to say I actually love it and have used it!

Operating the code is pretty straight forward. once you run the code it will give you five

if you like the song just reply with a "y" if not use an "n".

The algo will list the songs you like and at the end give you five more
recommendations based off the artist that you liked.
